1,2,1,A class is a building block of Object Oriented Programs. It is a user-defined data type that contains the data members and member functions that operate on the data members. It is like a blueprint or template of objects having common properties and methods.
1,2,2,"Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent multiple underlying data types or behaviors. There are two main types of polymorphism: compile-time (static) polymorphism and runtime (dynamic) polymorphism. Compile-time polymorphism is achieved through method overloading and operator overloading, where different methods or operators have the same name but different parameter lists or behaviors. Runtime polymorphism is accomplished through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method defined in its superclass, allowing different objects to respond to the same message in different ways. Polymorphism enhances code flexibility, reusability, and maintainability by promoting abstraction and encapsulation."
1,2,3,"Inheritance is a core concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or base class). The subclass inherits attributes and methods defined in the superclass, enabling code reuse and promoting hierarchical relationships between classes. Inheritance facilitates the creation of specialized classes that extend the functionality of existing classes while maintaining common characteristics. It supports the ""is-a"" relationship, where a subclass is a specific type of the superclass. Inheritance promotes code organization, modularity, and abstraction, leading to more manageable and scalable software systems."
1,2,4,"Classes do not use memory. They merely serve as a template from which items are made. Now, objects actually initialize the class members and methods when they are created, using memory in the process."
