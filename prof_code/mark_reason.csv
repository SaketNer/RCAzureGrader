1,1,6," Reasons: The student's answer correctly identifies three out of the four components of cookie technology as mentioned in the ideal answer and context provided by the textbook. The student mentions the cookie header lines in the HTTP response and request messages, as well as the cookie file kept on the user's end system and managed by the user's browser. However, the student misses mentioning the fourth component, which is a back-end database at the Web site. Since the student has partially written the points and has not included the fourth component, 2 marks are awarded for each of the three correctly identified components."
1,2,8," Reasons: The student's answer correctly identifies three out of the four components of cookie technology as mentioned in the ideal answer and context. The student mentions the cookie header line in the HTTP response message, the cookie header line in the HTTP request message, and the cookie file stored on the user’s system managed by the user’s browser. However, the student misses mentioning the back-end database located at the website. The student's response is partially correct for three components, so 2 marks are awarded for each correct point."
2,1,8," Reasons: The student's answer accurately describes the three-way handshake process in TCP connection establishment, including the client sending a small TCP segment, server acknowledgment, and client acknowledgment. The student also correctly mentions that the first two parts of the handshake take one round-trip time (RTT). Additionally, the student correctly states that after completing the handshake, the client sends the HTTP request message combined with the third part of the handshake into the TCP connection. However, the student's answer lacks the information about the server sending the HTML file into the TCP connection, which is a key part of the ideal answer and context provided by the textbook."
2,2,8," Reasons: The student's answer accurately describes the three-way handshake process in TCP communication, including the client sending a segment, the server acknowledging and responding, and the client acknowledging back to the server. The student correctly mentions that the first two parts of the handshake take one round-trip time (RTT). The student also correctly explains the process of sending the HTTP request message combined with the third part of the handshake into the TCP connection and the transmission of the HTML file by the server. However, the student's answer contains some minor deviations from the ideal answer and context, such as using the term ""total response time"" instead of ""total response time is"" and not explicitly mentioning the transmission time of the HTML file at the server."
1,1,6," Reasons: The student's answer correctly identifies three out of the four components of cookie technology as mentioned in the ideal answer and context provided by the textbook. The student mentions the cookie header lines in the HTTP response and request messages, as well as the cookie file kept on the user's end system and managed by the user's browser. However, the student misses mentioning the fourth component, which is a back-end database at the Web site. Since the student has partially written the points, 2 marks are awarded for each of the three correctly identified components. No marks are awarded for the missing component."

The student's response is partially correct for three components, so 2 marks are awarded for each correct point."
2,1,8," Reasons: The student's answer accurately describes the three-way handshake process in TCP connections, including the exchange of small TCP segments between the client and server, as well as the acknowledgment steps. The student correctly mentions that the first two parts of the handshake take one round-trip time (RTT). Additionally, the student correctly states that after completing the first two parts of the handshake, the client sends the HTTP request message combined with the third part of the handshake into the TCP connection. However, the student's answer lacks the information about the server sending the HTML file into the TCP connection after receiving the request message, which is a key point in the ideal answer and context. Therefore, 2 marks are deducted for missing this important detail."
2,2,8," Reasons: The student's answer covers most of the key points mentioned in the ideal answer and context. The student correctly explains the three-way handshake process in TCP communication, including the client sending a segment, server acknowledgment, and client acknowledgment. The student also mentions the HTTP request message being sent along with the third part of the handshake. The student accurately describes the total response time as approximately two RTTs plus the transmission time of the HTML file at the server. However, the student's explanation lacks some details present in the ideal answer, such as the specific mention of the acknowledgment in the third part of the handshake and the precise breakdown of the response time calculation. Additionally, the student's answer contains minor deviations in wording and structure from the ideal answer."
